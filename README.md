# code_refactor

1) Within the source code I had changed all the div to semantic elements matching between the HTML and CSS.
2) Added alt attributes to all added images.
3) Changed the h1, h2, h3, h4  to header, main, aside, and footer instead.
4) Changed the title.
5) Within CSS had combined selectors and properites that were the same styling and organized to be more structured.
